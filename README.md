# Notch, Please!

A simple Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.21.4-7 that aims to make vanilla UI elements fit better on Apple's notched MacBooks when in fullscreen mode.

### üì• Downloads

The latest releases of Notch, Please! can be downloaded [from the releases page](https://github.com/namekeptanonymous/notchplease/releases).

### üñ•Ô∏è Installation

Notch, Please! requires the [_Fabric_ mod loader](https://fabricmc.net/).

Notch, Please! is designed for MacBooks with display notches (M1 Pro, M2 and later). It will **not** work with other operating systems and may cause crashes if used elsewhere.

### üîß Usage

Since macOS's default fullscreen mode doesn't allow the game to extend into the notched area, you'll first need to enable Fullscreen under **Options ‚Üí Video Settings**.

Then, make sure your screen resolution is set to something like `2560x1664` (not the notch-less `2560x1600`) to take full advantage of the available space.

Once that's set up, I recommend using [RenderScale](https://modrinth.com/mod/renderscale) to reduce your resolution to Retina levels (typically by half). This can significantly improve performance with little to no visible loss in quality on a MacBook display.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building from source

Notch, Please! uses the [Gradle build tool](https://gradle.org/) and can be built with the `./gradlew build` (macOS/Linux) or `./gradlew.bat build` commands.
